            <p class="module-style">
                Web Development (CSY1063-STD) is a module I admire as a
                computing student. In this module, I have learnt the rubrics of
                how to create a well-structured and responsive website. During
                the course of leaning this module, I have completed series of
                activities in HTML and CSS to sharpen my skills in web
                developing. I have consulted many websites to gain more ideas
                of how to build more interactive website for users. Also, I have
                used some of my favorite websites as inspo for my portfolio
                website assignment. I have found useful resources to create very
                colorful website such as Coolors.com, font awesome for different
                icons of your choice and many more. With all I have learnt from
                this module, my focus is to continue to learn more to improve
                skills on how to create more interactive websites. Work with
                school and teams to create several e-commerce, web application
                and many UI/UX projects. Overall, I would rate this module 10/10
                for an outstanding delivery by Chris Rafferty and for his
                continuous support throughout this module.

            <h1><u>Mobile Optimization</u></h1>
            <p>
                When executing the Mobile Optimization of my code, I encountered
                series of errors.
                After several moment reading and watching through the
                materials on NILE, I still could not figure it out. So I decided
                to use a different approach to solve the errors I had. One of
                the major issue why it never worked was because I did not use
                GRID TEMPLATE and right SEMANTIC HTML to structure my code that
                is why the website is not responsive. Now, my portfolio website
                is responsive after I usesd the above solution. (See Below the
                attached screen for the mobile view)

            <h1><u>Semantic HTML</u></h1>
            <p>
                I have used the HTML 5 semantics to structure my code to the way
                I want my website content to display. The HTML semantic tags
                used are nav, header, main, article, aside, and footer. With
                these tags, it was easier to validate my code without errors and
                it make my website well structured and user friendly.

            <h1><u>CSS Properties</u></h1>
            <p>
                As requested, I created 3 CSS pages which contains all the
                styling for my website view both Desktop and Mobile. I have used
                different CSS Properties in my code to style my
                website for better view. I used a cool color scheme that blends
                wwith my taste and also not too flashy for user friendly. I have
                chosed my color from <a href="https://coolors.co/"
                    target="_blank">Coolors.</a>
